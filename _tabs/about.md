* Working in ISP as net Admin

Hello there, My name is Neno and you all know it. I work as a network administrator for the Croatian ISP "O Telekomunikacije", located in the north-west of my country. My education in systems and network engineering was completed at the local college "The Polytechnic of Meimurje in ÄŒakovec." I now have more than half of the yare in net-admin feald. I am always looking for more education. One time, a smart man said, "If you want to learn something, learn about as much as you can and then teach somebody else." This is my way to finish the mission, to learn more and teach somebody else about network and system topics. 
I currently have only a CCNA and my goal is to get at least a CCNP, some Mikrotik, and some other certifications to know the material well enough to be as best as possible in my job. 
I currently have two nice paperworks also, on the networking theme that I wrout last day's of education, my mentor and I wrote a paper on using GNS3 for network simulations and using the program in school. We have a problem where we cannot install prorpr software, so we use a RDM to connect to a virtual machine where we have a GSN3 client and a virtual environment with a GNS3 server. Also, I have my final work of my bachelor's degree on the topic of using a virtual router in a home or small business, how and why. Also, in my final work I compare several popular virtual router software in several ways to give a reader an idea of which VRS is best for their use. From beginners to hard-core pros,
