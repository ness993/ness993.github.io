Hello there, I am Neno, and you already know thet, but you can call me Neo. I currently work in local ISP(internet servcice provider) in north wes part of Croatia as Main Network Administrator. This website i start because i want to try new things in IT, and CI and using github as web server is nice to test. Mikrotik is currently my weak point, because i don't know as manny things as i need to know to start use them in evry day life, one time one smart guy has say learn all you can found about one topic then teach sombody eals about it", becose of then i also start this website. I must worn you currently have problems with may dyslexia, and dysgraphia, so if you found som mispelling you can report it on my github page under ISSUES, pleas.

On this website i well not try to write about tech topics and I will not try to teach you about IT topics. This week bee website on witch you can read and learn something about networking, also you as reader an go to my github repo under Issues and you may request IT topics on which i will write on this website.
